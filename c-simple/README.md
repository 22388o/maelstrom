# C-simple

C-simple is a basic and easy-to-use ("c-simple" means phonetically "it's easy !" in french) mobile(/desktop) interface to the [C-lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning) Lightning Network daemon. It uses an API (with [RPyC](https://github.com/tomerfiliba/rpyc)) hosted on top of the daemon and a mutual authentication with [x509 certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509), to make a secure connection possible from a [Kivy](https://github.com/kivy/kivy) mobile application.

This package is the API part, please find [more information about c-simple here](https://github.com/darosior/c-simple).
